Strange-looking girl is busily mashing buttons on a strange-looking console. {character.pronoun.subject} either does not notice me, or chooses not to acknowledge me.

{pause}

Pickett: Hello! (he is smiling, trying to be friendly)

{pause}

{character.pronoun.object} eyes briefly look up from behind {character.pronoun.object}cool-looking glasses.

{pause}

{character.pronoun.subject} goes back to button crunching.

{pause}

How should I get her attention?
{prompt}
[1. Say “hello” again]  (+0)
[2. Snatch away {character.pronoun.object} strange device]  (-2)
[3. Patiently wait for {character.pronoun.object} attention]  (+2)

If [1.]: Pickett: Hello!

{pause}

Girl (since we don’t know her name yet): Yeah, I heard you the first time! Whaddya want loser?

{pause}

Pickett: Uh, nevermind…

{pause}

If [2.]: I don’t think I’ll get much of a conversation from {character.pronoun.object} as long as {character.pronoun.subject} has that gizmo in {character.pronoun.possessive} hand.

{pause}

I take it away from {character.pronoun.object} to get {character.pronoun.possessive} attention.

{pause}

Girl (since we don’t know her name yet): Hey! What’s the big idea?! (she is angry)

{pause}

Pickett: Well, I was trying to get your attention—

{pause}

Girl: Just get lost, dork!

{pause}

{character.pronoun.subject} snatches back {character.pronoun.possessive} console and starts toying with it again.

{pause}

If [3.]: I patiently wait to speak with {character.pronoun.object}.

{pause}

After a few minutes, {character.pronoun.object} suddenly looks up.

{pause}

Girl (since we don’t know her name): Hey, you got any batteries on you?

{pause}

Pickett: Uh…

{pause}

Girl: Oh, nevermind, I think I’ve got some in my pocket.

{pause}

The girl fishes out a couple of batteries from {character.pronoun.possessive} pocket, crams them into {character.pronoun.possessive} gizmo, and continues fiddling with it.

{pause} (end of prompt)

Pickett: Um, if you don’t mind me asking, what is that thing?

{pause}

The girl looks up, a slight glimmer of excitement in {character.pronoun.possessive} eyes.

{pause}

Girl: I call this the Portable L143-5av3r. It kills the boredom in this dump. (she is happy)

{pause}

Pickett: Uh, did you buy that? Because it doesn’t look very well-manufactured…

{pause}

Girl: (angry) No, jerk! I made this on the bus ride! It looks like this because it’s a prototype I made from stuff I snuck in my bags.

{pause}

Girl: (happy again) I’ve already made several improvements on this model. I’ve got enough material to create a second prototype.

{pause}

My reaction:
{prompt}
[1. Don’t care]  (-1)
[2. Be enthusiastic]  (+1)

If [1.]: Oh. Cool, I guess.

{pause}

If [2.]: Wow, that’s pretty neat!

{pause} (end of prompt)

Since I now have {character.pronoun.possessive} attention, I take this opportunity to introduce myself.

{pause}

Pickett: By the way, I’m Pickett [player.lastname].

{pause}

Volga: Oh, I’m Volga.

{pause}

Pickett: (smile) Nice to meet you!

{pause}

Volga: Yeah, whatevs…

{pause}

Volga goes back to working on her L143-5av3r. Guess {character.pronoun.object} doesn’t want to talk right now…
(end)



If player tries to talk to Volga again:
Volga’s still working on her L143-5av3r prototype. She doesn’t look like she wants to be bothered right now.


NOTES:
1. The dialogue seems long, but it’s not too long. It just looks that way because of the prompts.
2. After writing “Girl”, I wrote “since we don’t know her name”. I just wrote that as an explanation for why I’m calling her “Girl”, it’s not part of the script.
3. The emotions in parenthesis (ex: “happy”, “smile”, “angry”) are just so appropriate expressions can be used on the sprites.
4. In case you didn’t catch it, “L143-5av3r” translates to be “Life-Saver”. ^__^ Tee hee.
