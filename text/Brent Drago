The boy is quietly singing something. {character.pronoun.subject} stops singing and smiles at me.

{pause}

Brent: Hi there! My name’s {character.name}. What’s your name?

{pause}

Pickett: I’m Pickett {player.lastname}.

{pause}

Brent: It’s nice to meet you!

{pause}

Brent: You may have recognized me. I’m a famous stylist.

{pause}

Brent: I have my own TV show. It’s called, “Beautification with Brent”.

{pause}

Brent: Have you ever watched it?

{prompt}

[1. Yeah, I love it! It’s my favorite show!]  (-1)
[2. Sorry, I’ve never watched it.]  (+2)
[3. What makes you think I’d watch a “beautification” show?]  (-2)

If [1.]: Oh, I’m glad you like it! I’m actually taking a break from the show for awhile. Sometimes show biz, fans, and the paparazzi can be a bit too much for a twelve-year-old.

{pause}

If [2.]: Oh, that’s ok. To be honest, I’m actually glad to hear that. I came to this camp wanting to meet normal kids around my age. I get enough correspondence from my fans and the media at home, so coming here and getting to be a normal kid instead of a star is a rare experience for me.

{pause}

If [3.]: Sheesh, sorry for asking!

{pause}

Brent: I’m really excited to be here. I can’t wait for all the activities to start!

{pause}
Brent: Which activities are you excited for?

{prompt}

[1. I’m excited to do crafts!]  (+2)
[2. I can’t wait to play some sports!]  (+0)
[3. None, I wanna go home.]  (-1)

If [1.]: Me too! I love creating and designing things, it’s so much fun!

{pause}

If [2.]: Oh, I’m not all that great at sports. I get injured easily.

{pause}

If [3.]: Aw, come on, we just got started! I’m sure camp’s going to be a lot of fun.

{pause}

Brent: Anyways, it was nice meeting you. See you around!

{pause}

Pickett: Bye, Brent!

{pause}

Brent leaves to introduce himself to the other campers.

If player tries to talk to Brent again:

Brent is talking with some of the other campers.
{pause}
It would be rude if I try to butt in.
