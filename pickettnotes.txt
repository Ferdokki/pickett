# Pickett Quick Summary & Notes #

Pickett Summary: Pickett is a Role Playing Game in which you take on the 

role of a young boy called Pickett (Last name comes from user input.) 

Pickett is an 11 year old boy from a big city who is begrudgingly sent 

to camp by his parents, who in turn go on vacation together for a month. 

After a short stay at the camp, it becomes clear that the new owners are 

using the camp to beckon something horrible and Pickett and his friends 

are the only ones that can stop it. The new owners of the camp, Barry & 

Sherry Fandling, are attempting to call what they think are ancient 

Native American spirits to the camp to possess the campers and send out 

into the world. Pickett is kind of nondescript and meant to act as a 

stand-in for the person playing the game. The game takes place through 

several phases, and a game could be potentially completed in a few hours, 

though it's unforgivingly difficult. The three phases are Encroachment, 

Subversion, & Insemination. 

*SCENES*

Encroachment: This is the opening phase of the game, when Pickett and the 

other campers arrive at the camp. This phase plays almost like Harvest 

Moon. The game holds your hand through several camp and bunk activities 

as you talk to your friends, meet other NPCs, and fight some relatively 

harmless monsters. Depending on how successful the character is in these 

endeavors, the Fandlings manage to summon several aliens to the camp. If 

the players do poorly, the players miss out on some items, and it will be 

harder to make some relationships with other campers. If the player does 

well, it's the opposite. 

Subversion: This is a week into the game. The Encroachment phase is 

over, and now other campers start to disappear and show up dead, or get 

recruited by the Fandlings. Depending on the relationships you make in 

the first week, and how deep these are, you can have up to four campers 

that end up following Pickett. Stuff gets really weird here, but the camp 

still tries to keep up appearances. Both, or one of the counselors will 

get fired (or killed) depending on how Pickett goes about the quests 

in this phase. If one is left alive, they will neutralize one of the 

camper bosses in the next phase. Campers will either be dead, recruited 

to Pickett's party, or the Fandlings' party by the end of this phase. If 

they have been recruited by the Fandlings, campers then are forced to 

ingest an alien body that then takes over its host. 

Insemination: This is the last phase of the game. The aliens have 

completely taken over the host campers, and the Fandling's have stationed 

them at different locations of the camp, each of them with minions of

their own. They have been ordered by the Fandlings to go out and wreak 

havoc in the world, ushering in a new world order. The player must go 

to each stronghold and destroy all of the minions, and the Fandlings, 

with whatever resources and characters they have left in their party. At 

this point most of the camp is on fire and it looks like something out of 

Mad Max. Ironically the Fandlings are calling this point in time "Color 

War" where they declare anyone not dressed in blue and white a threat. If 

Pickett survives, you win! Your last name will be recorded in the high 

scores with honor. If you lose, tough shit. 

Mini Scenes: These are the maximum allowed encounters for every day, 

which will include 2 random scheduled activities, 2 meals, and 1 social 

event (some special days will have 2 social events.)For the most part, 5 

mini scenes a day. In these scenes, randomly, NPC’s will be chosen from 

the pool, including campers, who can be persuaded to join your party in 

various scene, & set NPCs. 5 Mini Scenes makes a day and 35 mini scenes 

makes up a SCENE. 

Disposition: depending on how you answer certain questions, or respond 

to certain needs a camper or set NPC might have, the disposition of this 

character toward pickett rises, like in harvest moon. After a response 

has been given, that’s it, there are no other chances to get it right 

until another playthrough, and its not always obvious if a character 

likes you or not.

# Feature Ideas #

Permadeath & Crossover: If Pickett dies, it's game over. If any other 

camper dies, they are dead and lost for the duration of the game. As 

the game progresses, the kids that Pickett does not befriend (and 

it's impossible to be friends with everyone) will either randomly get 

killed or be recruited by the Fandlings to carry out their plan in the 

Insemination phase. Oh yeah, if Pickett dies, I think the game should
